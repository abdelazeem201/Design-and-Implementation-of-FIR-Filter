# Design-and-Implementation-of-FIR-Filter
R filter structure is designed with area and delay optimization is designed using Systolic Architecture and Associativity High Level Transformation technique in this paper. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter structure with optimized parameters is one of the major challenges in VLSI Signal Processing.
